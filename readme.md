# This will be my reconstruction of the GVC Landing Page


###### Gave dedicated repo
###### Set-up live server
###### Installed SASS
###### Split scss into components
###### Could have written the dropdown via a combination of JS and CSS but doing it (when possible) in pure CSS is always better; Upon request, I'll do another commit where it makes use of both
###### Used Mixin for Log-in button. Planning to reuse code for Green Button
###### Used Mixin in order to avoid css duplication for financial partner logos
###### Get Started button not displaying properly in mobile psd, need to ask Dragos about proper location
###### The jackpotValue in jackpotName Big Series is different than the number given in the test. (2098605.22 instead of "1192288.82) Need to ask Dragos. Probably data got updated.
###### For added realism I had the counter randomly increment between 00.1 and 00.5 every 5 seconds
